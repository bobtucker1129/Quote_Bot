## 📏 Paper Weight & Caliper

- Basis weight = lbs per 500 sheets of standard size—text and cover papers differ in sheet size and feel :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}
- GSM = weight per square meter; more universal metric
- Caliper = paper thickness in .001″ points, often correlates with basis weight
- Some specialty stocks (e.g., cotton/recycled) are thicker than they appear, e.g., 92 lb cover ~15 pt thickness :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}

## 🖨️ Digital vs. Offset & Color Options

- **Digital Printing**: toner baked, fast, ideal for personalization, can feel flat and may scratch :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}
- **Offset Printing**: high-resolution, cost-effective on higher runs, supports specialty inks & stocks :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}
  - Handles metallic, fluorescent inks, heavy stocks
- **CMYK vs Spot/Pantone**: CMYK = 4-color process, Pantone = spot for brand consistency, requires offset for accuracy :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}
- **Extended Gamut (Hexachrome)**: adds orange & green to better match PMS colors :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}

## 📘 Cardstock & Specialty Stocks

- Cardstock covers 50–110 lb basis (~135–300 gsm); thickness varies by fiber and finish :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}
- Example: Cotton/recycled Materica stock feels thicker; 92 lb cover ~15 pt thickness (.015″) :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}
